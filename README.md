# Ageing_Sign_Detection
Verzeo ML Ageing Sign Batch 21 </br>
Instruction manual </br>
Project Title: Signs of Ageing</br>
Project Description: A model to classify & localize different signs of ageing such as puffy eyes, wrinkles, dark spots on the face. The project requires knowledge of various domains. Use image processing techniques to process the image as per requirements. The model preferred to work upon is EfficientNet which will detect signs of ageing like puffy eyes, wrinkles, dark spots on the image. It should overlay bounding boxes around detected ageing signs.</br>
Packages to be installed before testing the model: </br>
•	CV2 </br>
•	Numpy </br>
•	Pandas </br>
•	Tensorflow </br>
•	OS </br>
•	Matplotlib </br>
•	Imutils </br>
Platform: I have used jupyter notebook for my code execution. </br>
Dataset: The dataset consists of various images. The zipped file has a dataset folder which further consists of ImageDataset, Train and test dataset. These three folders consists of dark spots, wrinkles and puffy eyes files having respective set of images. </br>
